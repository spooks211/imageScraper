1) Ensure python is installed on your system
2) Open a powershell window where the imagescraper.py and requirements.txt files are (Shift+Right Click in file explorer when the folder is open,
then press open powershell window here)
3) Pip must be installed for this to work, check whether pip is installed by typing "pip --version" on the powershell window
4) If it is, you will see the version, if not install it by entering "py -m ensurepip --upgrade" into the powershell window
5) Now you can install the packages that this script requires, do this by entering "pip install -r requirements.txt"
6) The script is now ready to run, you can do this either entering "python imageScraper.py" into powershell or by opening it 
in IDLE (or your favourite code editor) and running it through there.
